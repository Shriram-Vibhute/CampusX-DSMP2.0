-- Without using Subquerry
SELECT * FROM joins.movies

-- Because of indexing -> The ORDER BY approach is more faster than the subquerry (IMP ðŸ’•)

-- Find how many movies have a rating > the average of all the movie rating(Find the count of above movies)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM joins.movies
WHERE score > (SELECT AVG(score) FROM joins.movies);

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM joins.movies
WHERE score > AVG(score); -- Why this is not working
--  there is an issue with the use of the AVG(score) function directly in the WHERE clause. SQL doesn't allow aggregate functions like AVG to be used in the WHERE clause because WHERE is evaluated before the aggregation.

-- Find the highest rated movie in 2000 year
SELECT * FROM joins.movies
