pip is the package installer for Python."pip" does not have a universally accepted full form in Python. It allows you to install, manage, and update Python libraries and packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other repositories. Essentially, it's a tool that helps you easily add external libraries to your Python environment, which can provide additional functionality or simplify development tasks.
